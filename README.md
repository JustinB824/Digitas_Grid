# Digitas_Grid
A coding exercise for Digitas

I attempted to set up Gulp on this borrowed Windows machine.  I think it is very close, but I couldn't get some final steps to run.
Instead I just used sass --watch to compile my Sass.
I left the gulp files in the project just for kicks (but did not include the node_modules folder).

The structure of the page comes from a front-end boilerplate I helped develop at Mullen.  It is forked to my account, and also available on Mullen's public account.

I enjoyed working on this.  I could have kept adding functionality, but I think this is a pretty good example of how I work.  I hope you like it!
